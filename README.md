This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Visual Sorting Algorithm

This is a Visual Sorting Algorithm where the user is provided 4 algorithms to choose from: bubble, insertion, quick, and merge sort. 

Based on which algorithm the user chooses, the bars in the graph will sort themselves(low to high) based on the sorting algorithm selected. Red bars will appear during sorting to indicate which two bars are being compared with each other. The user can randomize the bars with the Randomizer button after the bars are in sorted order.

### Future Plans

Adding function to change sorting speed.
Adding function to change array length (number of bars).
