## Visual Sorting Algorithm

This is a Visual Sorting Algorithm where the user is provided 4 algorithms to choose from. Based on which algorithm the user chooses, the bars in the graph will sort themselves based on the algorithm selected. Red bars are used to indicate which two bars are being compared to each other with. The user can randomize the bars with Randomizer after the bars are in sorted order.
